## 🌟 **AI-Powered Veneer Visualization Project**

### 🎨 **Overview**
The AI-Powered Veneer Visualization application leverages deep learning to transform input images into realistic veneer visualizations. It allows users to preview veneer finishes on surfaces with customizable shade and brightness options, making it ideal for design and architectural visualization.

---

### 🚀 **Features**
- 📸 Upload any surface image for veneer visualization.  
- 🎚️ Adjust shade and brightness for customized results.  
- ⚡ Real-time image processing using a pre-trained Pix2Pix model.  
- 🌐 User-friendly web interface powered by Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- 🖼️ Downloadable output for further use.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, PyTorch  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Model:** Pix2Pix (Conditional GAN)  
- **Deployment:** WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
